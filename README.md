This project uses Meta’s Prophet model to train and predict the energy behavior of prosumers. The aim is to demonstrate how energy retail companies could use the Prophet model to manage their resources more efficiently. The advancement in technology has made generating and consuming energy accessible to energy customers on the grid, leading to the concept of energy “prosumers.” Motivated by social and economic factors, the number of prosumers continues to rise in various energy markets. 

While prosumers bring several advantages to the energy market, they also present challenges to energy retail companies. For example, many prosumers rely on unreliable renewable energy resources to produce energy, and in some cases, they either produce more than they consume or consume more than they produce. Therefore, it is vital for energy retail companies to predict energy surpluses or deficits from prosumers in order to manage resources efficiently.
